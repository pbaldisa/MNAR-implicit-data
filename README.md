# Understanding "Unbiased Recommender Learning from Missing-Not-At-Random Implicit Feedback"

This repository contains my attempt at further understanding and explaining the paper "Unbiased Recommender Learning from Missing-Not-At-Random Implicit Feedback". I have included a detailed explanation of the idea behind the paper, and some maths, in [post](post.md). I have also included a notebook that contains the code for the experiments in the paper, and some additional experiments. The notebook can be found [here](experiments.ipynb).

## Code by the original researchers
The code in this repository is based on the one provided by the original article [here](https://github.com/usaito/unbiased-implicit-rec-real).

## Requirements
In order to use the code in this repository, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
